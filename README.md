Hi Peeps, I am Roshan.

I am a dedicated Full Stack Developer, committed to continuous learning and professional growth. My expertise lies in core Java, Python, and C/C++, with a strong foundation in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). My ability to quickly assimilate new concepts enables me to effectively apply my expertise in ways that drive organizational growth and success.

During my tenure as a Senior Software Engineer at HCL Technologies, I honed my skills, primarily focusing on Java and Teamcenter (PLM) applications over a three-year period. I had the opportunity to collaborate with Ford Motor Company, contributing to the development and optimization of software solutions that enhanced operational efficiency and user experience.

I possess proficiency in a wide range of technologies, including JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for front-end development, as well as frameworks like Angular, React.js, and React Native. On the back end, I utilize Spring Boot and Node.js to build robust applications. My experience with containerization tools such as Docker and orchestration platforms like Kubernetes and OpenShift has further enriched my technical capabilities.

Additionally, I am well-versed in database management, with hands-on experience in SQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and Firebase. My familiarity with cloud services, including AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Azure DevOps, allows me to deploy scalable applications that meet modern business demands.

I am passionate about bringing my skills to organizations that share my vision of pushing the boundaries of innovation and design. My goal is to create impactful solutions that not only meet business objectives but also improve the lives of users through thoughtful, user-centered design and implementation.
